###Considerations

+ And although our bodies are bounded with skin, and we can differentiate between outside and inside, they cannot exist except in a certain kind of natural environment. - Alan Watts
+ Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe. 
+ God is a verb -- Bucky Fuller
+ Everything is ephemeral -- Digital documents should decay or evolve over time.
+ Technology must mimick nature and human experience if needs to relate to people.
+ Everything is connected.

### Technology

Everything is relative to the viewer. -- Client side processing, relevant to user. Content itself is shaped by viewer.


Capture as many stimuli about an experience as possible:

1. Location.
2. Visual Aspects.
3. Sound.
4. Thoughts.
5. Environment variables -- time(time of day), season, temperature, etc.(that which has no effect on technology but profoundly influences human experience)

#### Captured in real time. Necesity for mobile
